Cinematic Exploded View Automotive CGI — KSY GROUPE
1. PROJECT IDENTITY & CORE PHILOSOPHY

Brand: KSY GROUPE
Sector: Automotive certified spare parts distribution – fleet & professional vehicles
Core message to convey visually:

“We do not sell a car. We sell what is inside.”

Video usage:
Hero background video for homepage (looped, silent, atmospheric)

Tone & Positioning:

Ultra-premium corporate

Industrial precision

Engineering authority

African-rooted, globally modern

2. VIDEO FORMAT & DELIVERY CONSTRAINTS

Type: Pre-rendered CGI cinematic video

Resolution: 1920×1080 (Full HD) – web optimized

Aspect ratio: 16:9

Duration: 12–18 seconds

Loop: Perfect seamless loop (first and last frame identical in spatial state)

Audio: None (muted background video)

Compression target: Web-ready (MP4 / WebM)

3. 3D MODELING REQUIREMENTS (FOUNDATIONAL)
Vehicle Model

Modern sedan or SUV (neutral, non-brand-specific)

Fully disassembled mechanical structure

Every component must be:

Individually separated meshes

Correctly positioned in real mechanical hierarchy

Non-destructive topology (no fractured meshes)

Required Components

Exterior shell (panels, doors, hood, bumpers)

Engine block (certified spare parts emphasis)

Transmission system

Suspension components

Braking system

Cooling system

Electrical & electronic modules

⚠️ No single combined mesh allowed
Each piece must be logically independent.

4. EXPLODED VIEW ANIMATION LOGIC (CRITICAL)
Animation Style

Exploded view engineering animation

No chaos, no destruction, no random motion

Components separate progressively, following real-world assembly order

Motion Rules

Linear or radial displacements only

No exaggerated rotations

Smooth easing (ease-in / ease-out)

Constant velocity feel (industrial precision)

Animation Phases

Initial state: Fully assembled vehicle

Phase 1: Exterior panels separate outward

Phase 2: Subsystems emerge (engine, suspension, brakes)

Phase 3: Core certified spare parts subtly highlighted

End state: Balanced spatial exploded composition (readable, elegant)

⚠️ No collisions
⚠️ No overlapping geometry
⚠️ No particle effects

5. CAMERA & CINEMATOGRAPHY
Camera Behavior

Single continuous camera movement

Slow cinematic dolly + micro pan

No fast cuts, no aggressive zoom

Camera Settings

Focal length: 50–85mm (no distortion)

Stable horizon

Engineering documentation feel

🎯 Camera must serve understanding, not spectacle.

6. LIGHTING & MATERIALS (PREMIUM INDUSTRIAL)
Lighting Setup

Soft industrial HDRI base

Controlled key light (top/side)

Rim light for component separation

Soft shadows (area lights only)

Material Philosophy

Clean, matte to semi-gloss finishes

Metallic parts subtly reflective

No dirty textures, no wear & tear

7. COLOR DIRECTION — KSY GROUPE BRANDING (STRICT)

The vehicle must be designed using the brand colors, not simply tinted.

Color Distribution (MANDATORY)

Secondary – Dominant

Deep institutional midnight blue

HEX #0B1F3B

60% of visible surfaces

Used for:

Main vehicle body

Structural elements

Background contrast

Primary – Neutral

Pure white

HEX #FFFFFF

30%

Used for:

Internal components

Mechanical readability

Certified parts clarity

Accent – Premium

Matte gold

HEX #C9A24D

10%

Used for:

Key certified spare parts

Strategic highlights

Value signaling (never overused)

⚠️ No additional colors
⚠️ No gradients that alter brand tones

8. BACKGROUND ENVIRONMENT (AFRICAN IDENTITY)
Environment Concept

Minimalist cinematic background

Abstract African-inspired landscape:

Subtle desert horizon

Warm atmospheric depth

No literal scenery, no people, no buildings

Purpose

Evoke Africa as a market & origin

Maintain corporate seriousness

Avoid tourism or folklore clichés

Background must remain:

Soft focus

Darkened

Secondary to vehicle

9. POST-PROCESSING & FINAL LOOK

Subtle cinematic contrast

No aggressive color grading

Clean blacks

Slight vignette

No text overlays

No UI elements

The result must feel:

Calm

Confident

Technical

High-end

10. EMOTIONAL & SUBCONSCIOUS IMPACT

Viewer must feel:

Trust in engineering

Confidence in certification

Perception of mastery over automotive complexity

Unspoken message:

“KSY GROUPE understands every component of your vehicle.”

11. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS

❌ No explosions
❌ No futuristic sci-fi effects
❌ No holograms
❌ No gimmicks
❌ No marketing text inside the video

This is engineering visualization, not advertising animation.

12. FINAL OBJECTIVE

Deliver a cinematic exploded-view 3D video, inspired by Masuma’s technical philosophy, but fully reinterpreted for KSY GROUPE, integrating:

Brand colors

African context

Premium corporate identity

Certified spare parts expertise
